## Goals ##

In this exercise the main goal is to build 2 Hatespeech classification models

1. A keyword based model classifier

2. A Language Model (LM) based model classifier

This exercise is designed to evaluate your abilities to

    - understand an ML problem, propose and implement a solution
    - preprocess text data
    - implement simple ML models
    - evaluate the performance of ML models
    - compare the performance of different ML models
    - use good code development practises
    - use the typical tools of an NLP researcher/engineer....
